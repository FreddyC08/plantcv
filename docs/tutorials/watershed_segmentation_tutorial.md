## Tutorial: Watershed Segmentation Workflow

Check out our interactive watershed tutorial! This tutorial uses the analyze watershed segmentation function to roughly segment individual leaves. In this case, the number of objects reported from the analyze watershed function is a rough estimation of the number of leaves. The Watershed Segmentation Function is a PlantCV function based on code contributed by Suxing Liu, Arkansas State University. For more information see https://github.com/lsx1980/Leaf_count.
